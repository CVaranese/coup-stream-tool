## How to setup
These are instructions for regular OBS Studio, but I imagine you can do the same with other streaming software:
- Get the [latest release](https://github.com/Readek/RoA-Stream-Control/releases).
- Extract somewhere.
- Drag and drop `RoA Scoreboard.htlm` into OBS, or add a new browser source in OBS pointing at the local file.
  - If the source looks weird, manually set the source's properties to 1920 width and 1080 height, or set your OBS canvas resolution to 1080p, or make the source fit the screen.
- In the source's properties, change *Use custom frame rate* -> `60` (if streaming at 60fps of course).
- **Also tick `Refresh browser when scene becomes active`**. With it, the intro animation of the html will play each time we swap to this scene.
- Manage it all with the `RoA Stream Tool` executable.

Repeat from the 3rd step to add the `VS Screen.html`, though I recommend you to do so on another scene.

It is **very recommended** that you turn off the in-game top HUD. The overlay was made with that HUD off in mind.

### Interface shortcuts!
- Press `Enter` to update.
- Press either `F1` or `F2` to increase P1's or P2's score.
- Press `ESC` to clear player info.

For developing, there are some shorcuts to make things easier:
- Press `F5` to reload the GUI.
- Press `F6` to open the dev console. This will also unlock window resolution.

## Advanced setup
Yes, the instructions above are enough, but we can do better. **All of this is optional** of course.
 
2 basic transitions are included in the `Resources/OBS Transitions` folder, intended to be used to change to the game scene and to the vs screen, if you don't have a transition yourself of course. To use them on OBS:
- Add a new stinger transition.
- Set the video file to `Game In.webm` if creating the game scene transition, and `Swoosh.webm` if creating a vs screen transition.
- Transition point -> `350 ms`.
- I recommend you to set the Audio Fade Style to crossfade, just in case.
- On the scene's right click menu, set it to Transition Override to the transition you just created.
- Also, you may want to set a hotkey to transition to the game scene so you can press enter ingame to start the replay and press the transition key at the same time. The transition is timed to do so.

Also, you may find the "3 2 1" of the game's intro a bit distracting when combined with the scoreboard intro. [These](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NEDii3B50eHT_goADzn6t3_O8Uvok0Gs) are the sprites to remove them (using the [Modding Tool](https://github.com/jam1garner/gm_data_win/releases/latest)).

Also, you may wonder, what happened to the old, [lua scripted version](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15o52oz89siOJ5f_toD7zZDjp22dn2t73) of this controller? Well, turns out obs is just not ready for this kind of stuff. Current version of OBS doesn't have any kind of animator, and has to stutter to load every image you want to change, so it was really hard to get around that. Also, was much harder to update. With the javascript version, I wanted to make things better so I could update it with more ease. Anyways, the link of the old version will stay up if you ever want to know about lua obs scripting!

### Closing notes
This project is basically my learning grounds as a web developer. This is actually where I started learning javascript! As such, the code you're about to see may be unoptimized or badly written, so if you know how the web dev world works, please leave suggestions about how to improve the project as pull requests, or take a look at the [issues page](https://github.com/Readek/RoA-Stream-Tool/issues) to see if you can help with those! Any help will be greatly appreciated.
